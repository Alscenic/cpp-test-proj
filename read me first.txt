Here's a bunch of random things to note.


This project contains a bunch of code I experimented with over the Summer. All of it is mine and quite a
bit of it I tried and succeeded to write by myself without Google or StackOverflow.

Feel free to call me in to explain something to you or the class any time, I'll find some time to come over.
If one of my explanations doesn't make sense (a likely occurrance) email me and I'll write up a better and
probably more thourough explanation

I wrapped comments myself to make them easier to read. If you're using a computer lab screen or something
and you can't see all of it, just ctrl + scroll to zoom.
